# React Auth App
- [DEMO](https://auth-mpgxghsmg-kram-nick.vercel.app/)

Application where you enter your login credentials and after sign in it redirects you to Main page where you could see greeting message!
You can't go to Main Page without authorization and can't return to Login/Home Page without log out.

I used such techologies as React/TS, Tailwind CSS for quicker writing styles and some libraries for React.

To run this app you must clone this repository, after that run commands:

- npm i , download all modules
- npm run build, to build your project
- npm run start, start development server
